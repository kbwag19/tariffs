Tracking global trade tariffs dashboard.

### 📐 Wireframe

The initial wireframe for the "Follow the Box" interactive educational site is located in `frontend/smartphone_flow_wireframe.png`.

This mockup outlines the flow of selecting smartphone components, assigning countries of origin, tracking global manufacturing steps, and learning about tariffs applied at each stage. The goal is to create a simple, visual, and interactive tool that teaches users how international trade and tariffs impact product costs.
